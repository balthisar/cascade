Cascade 2.0 Final
=================


Changes Made:
o Changed the element list icons (left pane).
o Fixed emboldening problem with attaching/detaching the element list pane.
o Reworked the pickable-list editor for better intuitiveness.
o Fixed the wrong-version number for 2.0b9 in the help file.
o Various, small help-file corrections.
o Added new features to help file.
o Modified some of the attribute value menus for consistency/intuitiveness.
o Added the ability to import CSS/HTML.
   o Not supported:
     o the font property as shorthand.
     o the border, border-x-width, -color, and -style will all be interpreted and put
       into the border-x attributes, where x is top, bottom, left, or right. Also, the
       border proper will be split into the top, bottom, left, and right.
     o row-span and column-span will not be supported for import. They're not part of
       the specification, and it's only Cascade's inherintly-bad design that they're
       still present.
o Removed the row-span and column-span attributes from the Tables pane, since they were
  only part of the proposed specification, not the final recommended specification.
o If you import the "quotes" attribute and its not "inherited" or "none," the value will
  be set to typographical double-quotes for outside and single-quotes for inside.

Changes to Make:
o Live Preview of stylesheet.
o Tip-of-the-Day
o Make the fonts shown in the panes user-selectable.
o Preview-window scroll-bar should be user-selectable.
o Allow static "Preview All" with the option to leave the window where
  the user last left it, the option to keep the current selector at the top,
  the option to keep reverting the "Preview All" as is done now.
o Fix media-type closing brace problem.
o Shell-Menu-Opening extension.
