The average pitch of a voice depends on the voice family. For example, the average pitch for a standard male voice is around 120Hz, but for a female voice, it's around 210Hz.<BR>
Values have the following meanings:<BR>
<B>&lt;frequency&gt; <BR>
</B>Specifies the average pitch of the speaking voice in hertz (Hz). <BR>
<B>x-low</B>, <B>low</B>, <B>medium</B>, <B>high</B>, <B>x-high</B> <BR>
These values do not map to absolute frequencies since these values depend on the voice family. User agents should map these values to appropriate frequencies based on the voice family and user environment. However, user agents must map these values in order (i.e., 'x-low' is a lower frequency than 'low', etc.).
