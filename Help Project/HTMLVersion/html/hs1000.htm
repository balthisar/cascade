	This help file is <I>not</I> meant to be a replacement for adequate knowledge of the CSS2 specification. To make truly impressive stylesheets, some advanced knowledge of CSS2 is in order. To gain this knowledge, probably the <I>best</I> reference to CSS2 is from the people who wrote it: the World Wide Web Consortium. Much of the text related to CSS2 descriptions in this help file is from the official specification, and you can download the Adobe PDF version (suitable for printing) right here: </FONT><A HREF="http://www.w"><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="2">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/css2.pdf</FONT></B></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">.<BR>

</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">	The hyperlinks in this help have been color-coded to ensure that you do not connect to the internet unless you truly intend to. As is standard for Windows help files, internal hyperlinks are green and underlined. For example, </FONT><A HREF="hs1.htm"><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Table of Contents</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> will take you to the table of contents within this file.<BR>
	There are also several links throughout which connect to internet URL's or other internet services. When these are clicked upon, the appropriate application will launch, and your operating system will attempt to connect to the internet, if it is not already connected. These </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">"</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">external</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">"</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> hyperlinks are blue, as in the fashion of HTML documents.
