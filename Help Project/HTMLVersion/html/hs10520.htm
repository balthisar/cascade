<BR>
<I>Values for the width properties are as follows:<BR>
</I><B>thin</B> <BR>
A thin border. <BR>
<B>medium</B> <BR>
A medium border. <BR>
<B>thick</B> <BR>
A thick border. <BR>
<B>&lt;length&gt;</B> <BR>
The border's thickness has an explicit value. Explicit border widths cannot be negative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Values for the style properties are as follows:<BR>
</I><B>none</B> <BR>
No border. <BR>
<B>hidden</B> <BR>
Almost the same as none.<BR>
<B>dotted</B> <BR>
The border is a series of dots. <BR>
<B>dashed</B> <BR>
The border is a series of short line segments. <BR>
<B>solid</B> <BR>
The border is a single line segment. <BR>
<B>double</B> <BR>
The border is two solid lines. The sum of the two lines and the space between them equals the value of border-width. <BR>
<B>groove</B> <BR>
The border looks as though it were carved into the canvas. <BR>
<B>ridge</B> <BR>
The opposite of groove: the border looks as though it were coming out of the canvas. <BR>
<B>inset</B> <BR>
The border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas. <BR>
<B>outset</B> <BR>
The opposite of inset: the border makes the entire box look as though it were coming out of the canvas. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Values for the color properties are as follows:<BR>
