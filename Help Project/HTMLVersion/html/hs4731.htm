Cut:</B> This menu option removes the currently selected class from the class list, and puts its contents onto the system clipboard. You can then paste this data back into any <I>Cascade</I> document. When you cut, the textual CSS2 code is also placed on the system clipboard, so you can paste the text into any document you wish.
