Detach Class List:</B> This menu option allows you to detach the Class List from the main window, so that it can be positioned anywhere on the screen. You can also perform this operation by double-clicking the faux title bar while the Class List is attached. If the list is already detached, then this option re-attaches the Class List to the left side of the main window.
