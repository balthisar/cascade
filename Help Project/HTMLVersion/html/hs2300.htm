</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">	"Beta" software is not really "free" software. By using the software, you have agreed to a license. The license does not <I>require</I> that you, the user, report information to the application developer.<BR>
	However, beta software is released free-of-charge for the purpose of soliciting feedback about the quality of an application. Some large mega-corporations release program suites, and even entire operating systems, for the purpose of beta-testing, <I>without informing the user</I>, and charging anywhere from $100 for a simple Windows-based operating system to $500 for a full Office suite. These same companies then have the nerve to charge the user additional money for "telephone support" in order to report the bugs!<BR>
	Part of a beta-tester's moral obligation is to report bugs and suggest ideas for the application. This is a meager pittance for free use of a valuable application. So, dear user, please do your part!<BR>
	Submitting feeback is especially easy if you have a connection to the internet, which you most likely do, since you are using this application.
