Detach Code Preview:</B> This menu option allows you to detach the Code Preview Pane from the main window, so that it can be positioned anywhere on the screen. You can also perform this operation by double-clicking the faux title bar while the Code Preview Pane is attached. If the pane is already detached, then this option re-attaches the Code Preview Pane to the right side of the main window.
