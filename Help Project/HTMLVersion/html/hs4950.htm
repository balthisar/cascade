	The color picker is composed of two main parts: the composite, or "Current Color" portion on the right, and the available colors list on the left.<BR>
	As you select colors on the left, a description of the color name appears near the middle of the dialog, and the composite color updates to show you the current color <I>as it appears on your own system</I>.<BR>
	Because system colors can and do vary from system to system, as well as from platform to platform, ensure that you use them wisely. Their purpose it intended to elegantly integrate portions of your content with the users' own operating systems.
