</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Interactive user agents sometimes change the rendering in response to user actions. CSS provides three pseudo-classes for common cases:
<LI>The <B>:hover</B> pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element (with some pointing device), but does not activate it. For example, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the cursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element. User agents not supporting interactive<U> </U>media do not have to support this pseudo-class. Some conforming user agents supporting interactive<U> </U>media may not be able to support this pseudo-class (e.g., a pen device).
<LI>The <B>:active</B> pseudo-class applies while an element is being activated by the user. For example, between the times the user presses the mouse button and releases it.
<LI>The <B>:focus</B> pseudo-class applies while an element has the focus (accepts keyboard events or other forms of text input).<BR>
	These pseudo-classes are not mutually exclusive. An element may match several of them at the same time. <BR>
CSS doesn't define which elements may be in the above states, or how the states are entered and left. Scripting may change whether elements react to user events or not, and different devices and UAs may have different ways of pointing to, or activating elements.<BR>
	User agents are not required to reflow a currently displayed document due to pseudo-class transitions. For instance, a style sheet may specify that the font-size of an :active link should be larger than that of an inactive link, but since this may cause letters to change position when the reader selects the link, a UA may ignore the corresponding style rule.
