Pseudoclass of a Subclass</B>:
<LI>In the <I>Cascade</I> program, the term "class" is used to refer to any item in the class list. A Pseudoclass defines attributes which should be used only when the user agent dynamically decides the attributes should be used. For example, A:visited can describe the appearance of visited links on the HTML page. It is up the the user agen to determine if a link is visited, and if so, to apply the A:visited class description instead of the A:link description (for unvisited links). The purpose of distinguishing whether a pseudoclass is a normal pseudoclass or a pseudoclass of an existing subclass makes application management simpler for the user.
