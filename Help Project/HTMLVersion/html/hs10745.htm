(It may be that the element itself has floating descendants; the 'clear' property has no effect on those.) <BR>
	This property may only be specified for block-level elements (including floats). For compact and run-in boxes, this property applies to the final block box to which the compact or run-in box belongs.<BR>
<BR>
Values have the following meanings when applied to non-floating block boxes:<BR>
<B>left</B> <BR>
The top margin of the generated box is increased enough that the top border edge is below the bottom outer edge of any left-floating boxes that resulted from elements earlier in the source document. <BR>
<B>right</B> <BR>
The top margin of the generated box is increased enough that the top border edge is below the bottom outer edge of any right-floating boxes that resulted from elements earlier in the source document. <BR>
<B>both</B> <BR>
The generated box is moved below all floating boxes of earlier elements in the source document.. <BR>
<B>none</B> <BR>
No constraint on the box's position with respect to floats. <BR>
<BR>
	When the property is set on floating elements, it results in a modification of the rules for positioning the float. An extra constraint is added: 
<LI>The top outer edge of the float must be below the bottom outer edge of all earlier left-floating boxes (in the case of 'clear: left'), or all earlier right-floating boxes (in the case of 'clear: right'), or both ('clear: both'). <BR>
