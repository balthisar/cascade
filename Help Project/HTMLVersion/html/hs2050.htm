</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">	<I>Cascade</I>'s most prominent new feature is the ability to manage multiple "media types," as specified by the W3C. This means that a <I>Cascade</I>-generated stylesheet can now invoke different style rules, depending upon the media in which your stylesheet is used. Note: it's up to the particular browser to use different media type rules. Media-type enabled documents are mostly backward compatible with older versions of <I>Cascade</I>. Older versions of the application will open newer documents without crashing or doing anything strange. We decided <I>not</I> to upgrade the document format at this time to facilitate this.<BR>
	In addition, the screen display has been fixed for certain users who changed particular Windows fonts. This resulted in a particularly messy display of the <I>Cascade</I> screen. <I>Cascade</I> now ensures that its display is static, no matter the resolution and fonts of the monitor on which it runs.<BR>
	In order to allow the new media types to work, it was also necessary to allow the user the option to turn off the "hand-holding" feature that prevented users from creating selectors with duplicate names. The reason for this is that different media types probably will have the same selectors. A fringe benefit of this is that users can now use multiple specifications of selectors for any other reason allowed by the CSS2 specification. In other words, <I>Cascade</I> just got a whole lot more flexible for advanced users.<BR>
<BR>
	Several interim versions of <I>Cascade</I> have surfaced over the last couple of months. These were efforts to prevent a bug from occurring in certain versions of the Windows operating system, whereby files could not be saved or exported. Since release 2.0b6, we're proud to say that there have been no new occurrances of this bug reported!
