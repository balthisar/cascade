It may be set for elements that generate boxes that are not absolutely positioned. The values of this property have the following meanings:<BR>
<B>left</B> <BR>
The element generates a block box that is floated to the left. Content flows on the right side of the box, starting at the top (subject to the 'clear' property). The 'display' is ignored, unless it has the value 'none'. <BR>
<B>right</B> <BR>
Same as 'left', but content flows on the left side of the box, starting at the top. <BR>
<B>none</B> <BR>
The box is not floated.<BR>
<BR>
Here are the precise rules that govern the behavior of floats:<BR>
The left outer edge of a left-floating box may not be to the left of the left edge of its containing block. An analogous rule holds for right-floating elements. <BR>
If the current box is left-floating, and there are any left floating boxes generated by elements earlier in the source document, then for each such earlier box, either the left outer edge of the current box must be to the right of the right outer edge of the earlier box, or its top must be lower than the bottom of the earlier box. Analogous rules hold for right-floating boxes. <BR>
The right outer edge of a left-floating box may not be to the right of the left outer edge of any right-floating box that is to the right of it. Analogous rules hold for right-floating elements. <BR>
A floating box's outer top may not be higher than the top of its containing block. <BR>
The outer top of a floating box may not be higher than the outer top of any block or floated box generated by an element earlier in the source document. <BR>
The outer top of an element's floating box may not be higher than the top of any line-box containing a box generated by an element earlier in the source document. <BR>
A left-floating box that has another left-floating box to its left may not have its right outer edge to the right of its containing block's right edge. (Loosely: a left float may not stick out at the right edge, unless it is already as far to the left as possible.) An analogous rule holds for right-floating elements. <BR>
A floating box must be placed as high as possible. <BR>
A left-floating box must be put as far to the left as possible, a right-floating box as far to the right as possible. A higher position is preferred over one that is further to the left/right.
