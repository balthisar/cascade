</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">	The following controls are used in the </FONT><A HREF="hs4400.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">attributes panes</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> to specify the values for the attributes in the classes you design. Most of the controls are standard Windows controls, but some of the controls merit special mention.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Check Boxes are standard Windows controls that allow you to select whether a single option is turned on or off. The example at the left shows two check boxes: the topmost is turned on; the bottommost is turned off.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Radio Buttons are standard Windows controls that allow you to select a single option among many options in a discrete group. The example at the left shows three such buttons, the topmost of which is selected.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Edit Boxes are standard Windows controls that allow you to enter single lines of text. Some of the attribute values in <I>Cascade</I> require you to provide information that is not selectable, and Edit Boxes provide you the ability to provide that information. <I>Note:</I> some attribute values require a great deal of textual information that is not easily displayed in a small Edit Box. Instead, these text items use Combo Editors, shown next.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Combo Editors serve multiple functions, and are not a standard part of the Windows interface. As mentioned above, a Combo Editor can act in place of an Edit Box. You can type short, textual information into them, or, press the ellipsis button, and a larger text-editing area will open allowing you to type in a larger amount of text. This style of Combo Editor is in the top part of the illustration to the left. In addition, Combo Editors are used for attributes which require a color value. In this style of Combo Editor, you cannot enter a value directly. Instead, the ellipsis button activates <I>Cascade</I>'s </FONT><A HREF="hs4900.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">HTML Color Picker</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">. This style of Combo Editor is pictured in the bottom part of the illustration to the left.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Drop-Down Lists are standard Windows controls that allow you to select one option from among many choices. Generally, you are not allowed to type information not present in the list into the Drop-Down List's text-editing area. However, in the case of Font-Family Drop-Down Lists, you <I>can</I> type information directly into the text-editing area, which allows you to specify fonts not present on your own system.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">LED Check Boxes are similar to standard Windows Check Boxes, in that they allow you to turn a single option either on or off. In the illustration to the left, the states are shown from left to right as "off" and then "on." In the case of <I>Cascade</I>, any LED Check Box serves to designate a class attribute as being "important" or not. By marking an attribute important, the user's web browser will place more weight on the instructions provided in your style sheets.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A Spin Editor provides you with the means to either type in a number, or to operate the arrows to increase or decrease the number in the editor. In addition, <I>Cascade</I> has added a feature to all of the applicable Spin Editors: right-clicking applicable Spin Editors brings up a </FONT><A HREF="hs4150.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">contextual menu</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> with the opportunity to toggle whether the Spin Editor is displaying whole numbers (numbers without decimals) or not.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A Pop-Up Menu is a type of control not ordinarily used in Windows, but if you've ever used a Macintosh, you will appreciate their implementation in <I>Cascade</I>. A Pop-Up Menu serves a similar purpose to Drop-Down Lists, although in a more attractive style. The illustration to the left shows how a Pop-Up Menu usually looks. The "name" on the menu reflects the currently selected choice in the menu.<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">This second illustration demonstrates what a Pop-Up Menu looks like when you have popped it up. It's pretty similiar to standard Windows contextual menus in appearance. All available menu options are shown on the menu, and the currently selected option appears with a checkmark to the left. If you select a new option, the name of the Pop-Up Menu will be replaced to reflect the change.
