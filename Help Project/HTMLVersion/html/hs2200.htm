</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">	The future of <I>Balthisar Cascade</I> is looking like this right now:
<LI>Version 2.0b9 will need to have its bugs fixed, </FONT><A HREF="hs20100.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">if there are any</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">remaining, and </FONT><A HREF="hs2300.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">if the beta-testers report them faithfully</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">.
<LI>A live-preview plug-in is planned. This will enable <I>Cascade</I> users who have IE4+ installed on their systems to see near-instant results of their stylesheet modifications (the <I>Cascade</I> application currently allows a preview in browser feature which works in conjunction with existing HTML markup).
<LI>An import-css plug-in is in development. This will allow <I>Cascade</I> to import existing CSS files, and to parse existing HTML files into <I>Cascade</I>.
<LI>Eventually, version 2.0 will move <I>out</I> of beta, which means I will no longer distribute the application for free. If you still have the beta version at that time, then it's yours to keep and use forever (this program will <I>not</I> expire). But if you enjoy the application and want continued support, you may want to consider obtaining the shareware version in the future. There is no anticipated date for this transition yet -- the application must be "perfected" first.
<LI>The shareware version will be released. This application and its help file are the result of over 1200 hours of work. At an average programmer's pay, you can do the math and figure out its value. Because the shareware version will likely cost US$10-$20, I would have to receive 2,250 to 4,500 paid registrations  to "break even." As you know, that is probably a ridiculous number, and you should see that I really do all this work for the mere love of it.
<LI>New! The Freeware/Shareware plan has been finalized! A single version of <I>Cascade</I> will be released that is both Shareware and Freeware. Users can choose to register if they care to, and they won't be made to feel guilty if they don't (i.e., there will be no annoying, constant reminders except for the first time the program is run). The Freeware/Unregistered version will lack only one feature -- the ability to use plug-ins.
