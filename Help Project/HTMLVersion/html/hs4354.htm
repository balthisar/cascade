Copy Selected Text:</B> This menu option copies the selected text in the preview pane onto the system clipboard, where you can paste the text into other applications. <I>Note:</I> it is normal for Windows to replace the contents already on the clipboard with any new data you copy. Therefore, if you've copied or cut classes from the class list, that information will be replaced. Instead of copying text from the preview pane to obtain CSS2 code, it is recommended that you copy the class you are interested in from the </FONT><A HREF="hs4200.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">class list</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="1"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">. This will put the textual CSS2 code into the clipboard as well. Alternatively, you can use one of <I>Cascade</I>'s export functions.
